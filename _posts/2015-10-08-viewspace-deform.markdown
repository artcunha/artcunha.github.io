A very common problem we face in stylized 3d is dealing with perspective, as experienced during my time on Spiderverse.

Foreshortening is one of the core drawing fundamentals - it describes how quickly objects distort and fall into perspective. In a lot of art styles, this can be exaggerated to create more dynamic poses.

The idea with this deformer is to allow artists to apply a varied focal length at different points of the object(s) based on a user-defined distance. This allows for a variety of effects, from non-linear perspective, to distortion fixesâ€¦ much like in drawing.
