A very common problem in 3d animation is dealing with perspective in, what's often called, "posing to camera".

Foreshortening is a core drawing fundamental - it describes how quickly objects distort and fall into perspective. This doesn't always follows linear rules and it's often pushed by artists. 

The idea with this deformer is to give animators the control of that foreshortening on object basis, based on a user-defined distance. This also provides a non-destructive way of posing to camera, which can potentially enhance workflows with downstream departments like layout and sim.
