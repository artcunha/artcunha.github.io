This was Boulder Media’s first CG feature film, as well as my first production experience.

## Tools

Most of my time as an Animation TD was spent developing and supporting pipeline tools. Some of them were:

- **Rig Browser** : A library UI for intuitive load and manage scene assets
- **Crowd Caching** : A workflow to quickly toggle between caches and rigs that greatly sped up work on shots with multiple characters.
- **Layout-to-Anim Scene Prep** : Automatic process to generate renders and anim scenes from low-lod previs publishes.
- **Re-Publisher** : A flexible gui designed to be used by a variety of people in production, able to batch though multiple shots to update/replace assets or run custom scripts.
- **Anim Publish Validation Checks** : Scene tests that were run before every publish to ensure certain conditions were met.

## Shot/Sequence Setups

A lot of sequences required one-off setups that didn’t justify the time, or were too specific to warrant a fully fledged tool. This would usually be handed off to me to achieve it by writing specific snippets. By the end of the show, I had curated a significant code library that allowed us to address any note very quickly. Some of these included:

- Procedural variation scattering
- Batch asset updates and animation transfers
- Creating and sending off custom QC Katana templates
- Animation Library storage from shots

*One of the hardest sequences due to the amount of bunnies. I worked closely with the lighting lead to ensure the setup was transferable across shots.*

## Tech-Anim

Towards the end of production I got the chance to help out with shot work and anim fixes. This included a range of tasks from hair and cloth to props.
